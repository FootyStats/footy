# Footy

Footy - A statistics module for football (soccer).


### class footy.Footy()
Main class of the footy module.

Please note that methods that accept a team name parameter that the team name must match exactly (including case
sensitivity).  Use the get_teams method to get a list of valid team names.

### Examples

```python
>>> import footy
>>> widget = footy.Footy()
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Arsenal', 64, 36, 18, 19, 69))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Aston Villa', 53, 48, 18, 19, 59))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Blackburn', 40, 60, 18, 19, 40))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Bolton', 41, 52, 19, 18, 41))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Chelsea', 65, 22, 19, 18, 80))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Everton', 53, 37, 19, 18, 60))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Fulham', 39, 32, 18, 19, 53))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Hull', 39, 63, 18, 19, 35))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Liverpool', 74, 26, 18, 19, 83))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Man City', 57, 50, 18, 19, 47))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Man United', 67, 24, 19, 18, 87))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Middlesbrough', 27, 55, 19, 18, 32))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Newcastle', 40, 58, 19, 18, 34))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Portsmouth', 38, 56, 19, 18, 41))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Stoke', 37, 51, 19, 18, 45))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Sunderland', 32, 51, 18, 19, 36))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Tottenham', 44, 42, 19, 18, 51))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('West Brom', 36, 67, 19, 18, 31))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('West Ham', 40, 44, 18, 19, 48))
>>> widget.add_team(Team('Wigan', 33, 45, 18, 19, 42))
```

league position and goal difference).

>>> widget.dataframe()
```

Setting the number of average goals scored.

```python
>>> widget.average_goals_scored_by_a_home_team(1.36)
>>> widget.average_goals_scored_by_an_away_team(1.06)
```

Now get the prediction of game (will return None if not enough data is
available).  For the full details of the response returned, see the
fixture method.

```python
>>> response = widget.fixture(widget.get_team('Arsenal'), widget.get_team('Stoke'))
```

Get a list of all the teams from the dataset.

```python
>>> widget.get_team_names()
['Arsenal',
 'Aston Villa',

```

Get the data specific to Arsenal.

```python
>>> team = widget.get_team('Arsenal')
```

Get a Bried Score for a result.

```python
>>> footy.brier_score(np.array([1, 0, 0]), np.array([1.0, 0.0, 0.0]))
0.0

#### add_team(team)
Add a team to the table.


* **Parameters**

    **team** (*footy.domain.Team.Team*) – The team to set or update (using the team name as a key) in Footy object.



#### attack_strength(team)
Get the attack strength of a team.

The attack strength is calculated by dividing the number of goals scored by the team by the average goals
scored by any team.  An attack strength higher than 1.0 indicates that the team scores more than the
average number of goals by a team in the competition.


* **Parameters**

    **team** (*footy.domain.Team.Team*) – The team to get the attack strength of.



* **Returns**

    The attack strength of the team.  If there is not enough data to
    calculate this correctly, return None.



* **Return type**

    float



* **Raises**

    **KeyError** – When a team that is provided that is not in the dataset.



#### average_goals_scored_by_a_home_team(goals=None)
Get or set the average goals scored by a home team.


* **Parameters**

    **goals** (*float**, **optional*) – The average number of goals scored by any team playing at home over the duration of the season.



* **Returns**

    The average number of goals scored by any team playing at home over the duration of the season.



* **Return type**

    float



#### average_goals_scored_by_an_away_team(goals=None)
Get or set the average goals scored by an away team.


* **Parameters**

    **goals** (*float**, **optional*) – The average number of goals scored by any team playing away over the duration of the season.



* **Returns**

    The average number of goals scored by any team playing away over the duration of the season.



* **Return type**

    float



#### brier_score(y_true, y_prob)
Return a Brier Score of the probability against the actuality.


* **Parameters**

    
    * **y_true** (*np.array*) – What actually happened.  Should be a value for each predicted category (e.g. home win, score draw or away
    win).


    * **y_prob** (*np.array*) – The predicted probability of each category.  The number of elements in this parameter must match the number
    of parameters given in y_true. The sum of all the values of this list cannot exceed 1.0.



* **Returns**

    A value between 0.0 and 2.0 where a value closer to 0.0 indicates that a predicted probability was more
    accurate that a value closer to 2.0.  This result will be rounded to the nearest two decimal places.



* **Return type**

    float
